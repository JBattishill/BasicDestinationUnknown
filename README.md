### Reflection

## [Destination Unknown - Glitch Link](https://destinationunknown.glitch.me).

I chose to a web App for travellers looking for a travel location or month or people who just want to get excited about somewhere they are already heading.

## Demographic:
**age -** 18+
**income level -** All income levels, anyone can dream about travelling!.
**cultural background -** All cultures
**employment -** All employment levels
**location -** It was built to be functional for people from everywhere that uses Celcius...
**level of education -** All levels

## Goals
• An app that would allow a user to put in any city in the world and any month and they would receive information about the estimated weather at that time and some photos.
• A bright, interesting site that is functionally sound and technically complex.
• Accessible and Responsive
• Once I had gotten functionality pretty well set in, I set a new goal of trying to prevent errors as there were multiple places that the App would fail.

## Inspiration
I honestly didn't take much inspiration from anywhere, I guess a little from my portfolio... www.juxforyou.com - 
Mostly the site was built as function over form until right at the end, at which point it was mostly about making things responsive before pretty.
It still looks nice

## Production Process
I started with just trying to connect to an API and pull any data into a basic JS/HTML webpage. I connected to the Canberra Modern API's building page and was able to get that data.
From there I changed the connection point to the GeoApify to get a locations's geoLocation, using there example API call, once I had that i tried setting a variable with Paris France in it and called the API using the variable. Once I had that functioning I was sailing through like a breeze, connecting to API's left and right...

Well thats what I wish I could say... 

Honestly it was frustrating most of the way but I learned some valuble lessons about API sensitivity with both input data and targetting the output data and I had fun during the whole project

### Lessons learned
**APIs are sentive as all heck** 

The Amount of error messages I got, spelling mistakes, too many numbers in a latitude, capital letters, no capital letters... it was the most difficult part.

**Responsiveness is more difficult in basic CSS** 
I wanted to try and implement TailwindCSS to bring that back but by the time I got to that point I felt it was more effort than just learning to do better reponsive CSS.

**I have improved so much over the course of my studies!!**
This was fun, difficult but fun! I could really feel myself having significantly more programming skills than in previous assignments. 
It was nice to go back to basic HTML/CSS/JS and just crush my goals, nothing felt too difficult.


**Thanks for a great semester**
